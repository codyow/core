	<p class="text-lg pb-4">Dear Colleagues:</p>
	<p class="text-lg pb-4">Welcome to the first ABA Business Law Section Virtual Spring Meeting! Section meetings have always been an opportunity for connection and collaboration of business law practitioners and thought leaders from around the world.  Since the pandemic and related public health concerns currently prevent us from meeting in person, we have developed an engaging virtual format providing topical content and networking opportunities to business law attorneys and other professionals at all stages of practice (including law students!) and practice settings. The Spring Meeting offers a wide array of practical, expert content, from overviews of current trends to in-depth analysis of complex issues. All CLE programs will be recorded and available for on-demand credit after the meeting to Meeting registrants.  I encourage you to take advantage of everything the Meeting has to offer. </p>
	<p class="text-lg pb-4">Attendees of the Virtual Spring Meeting can expect the same high-quality experience of any in-person Business Law Section meeting, in an immersive online platform.</p>
	<p class="text-lg pb-4"><strong>Highlights of the Meeting</strong> include:</p>
